**********************************************
* Isam.pm a Perl module to access C-Isam files
**********************************************

Having unsuccessfully searched the Internet for months to find a Perl 5 
module to access Informix C-Isam files, I have finally decided to do it
myself. As I extensively use GNU/Linux software at work and at home, this is 
also an opportunity to give something back to the community.

WARNING !!!
-----------
This is currently ALPHA software.  Not all methods have been tested yet. 
Use it at your own risks !
All suggestions from the Perl gurus to improve the code are welcomed.

What is Isam ?
--------------
Isam stands for Indexed Sequential Access Method. On Unix platforms the most
famous product is C-Isam from Informix.
Also this seems outdated compared with modern SQL databases, Isam is still
very important for many people who run old legacy software with data stored
in this format.

Module requirements
---------------------
- Perl 5.005 or later
- C compiler (gcc or other)
- Isam library (tested with Informix C-Isam and ByteDesigns D-Isam)

Where to download the module
----------------------------
Save the following link 
http:://www.oceanes.fr/~database/download/Isam-0.1.tar.gz

How to install
--------------
- untar the compressed archive. For example: 
  tar xvzf Isam-0.1.tar.gz  
- cd Isam-0.1
- vi Makefile.PL
  You probably will have to change the following line
  'LIBS'      => ['-ld96'],   # e.g., '-lm' 
  for example, to link with Informix C-Isam, change it to
  'LIBS'      => ['-lisam'],   # e.g., '-lm'
- perl Makefile.PL
- make
- make test
- make install
  (as root) 

Why not write a DBI module ?
----------------------------
DBI is a vendor independant database interface for Perl analogous to ODBC. 
BUT it has been designed to use SQL databases et does not fit at all ISAM
interface. Writing a DBI module for C-Isam would be considerably more time-
consuming than the few days I have spent to write the present module.

Reference Material
------------------
- C-Isam Programmer's Manual version 7.2 april 1996, can be downloaded from 
  Informix oldsite.  Use Altavista or Yahoo to locate the link.
- You can download a time limited version of the D-Isam library from 
  www.bytedesigns.com
